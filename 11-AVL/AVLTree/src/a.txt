I. The Period
It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven,
we were all going direct the other way--
in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
that things in general were settled for ever.

It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally
deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the
earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
brood.

France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her
Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue
torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty
yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and
Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,
already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into
boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were
sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with
rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which
the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of
the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about
with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.

In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman
in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the
failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;
that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London
gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law
fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;
thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search
for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the
musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences
much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of
sixpence.

All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,
those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the
fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small
creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the
roads that lay before them.

Cocos2D is a powerful library for the iPhone that can save you a lot of time while building your iPhone game. It has sprite support, cool graphical effects, animations, physics libraries, sound engines, and a lot more.

I am just starting to learn Cocos2D, and while there are various useful tutorials on getting started with Cocos2D out there, I couldn’t find anything quite like what I was looking for – making a very simple but functional game with animation, collisions, and audio without using too many advanced features. I ended up making a simple game of my own, and thought I’d write a tutorial based on my experience in case it might be useful to other newcomers.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a simple game for your iPhone with Cocos2D, from start to finish. You can follow along with the tutorial, or just jump straight to the sample project at the end of the article. And yes. There will be ninjas.

. .Downloading and Installing Cocos2D

You can download Cocos2D from the Cocos2D Google Code page. As of this blog post, the latest version is 0.99.0-final – this is what we’ll be using for the tutorial.

After you pull down the code, you’ll want to install the useful project templates. Open up a Terminal window to the directory you downloaded Cocos2D to, and enter the following command: ./install_template.sh

Note that you can optionally pass a parameter to the install script if you have XCode installed to a non-standard directory (like you might have done if you have more than one version of the SDK on your machine).

. .Hello, Cocos2D!

Let’s start by getting a simple Hello World project up and running by using the Cocos2D template we just installed. Start up XCode and create a new Cocos2D project by selecting the cocos2d-0.99.0 Application template, and name the project “Cocos2DSimpleGame”.


Cocos2D is organized into the concept of “scenes”, which are kind of like “levels” or “screens” for a game. For example you might have a scene for the initial menu for the game, another for the main action of the game, and a game over scene to end. Inside scenes, you can have a number of layers (kind of like in Photoshop), and layers can contain nodes such as sprites, labels, menus, or more. And nodes can contain other nodes as well (i.e. a sprite could have a child sprite inside it).

If you take a look at the sample project, you’ll see there’s just one scene – HelloWorldScene – and we’re going to start implementing our main gameplay in there. Go ahead and open it up – you’ll see that right now in the init method it’s adding a label that says “Hello World” to the scene. We’re going to take that out, and put a sprite in instead.

. .Adding A Sprite

Before we can add a sprite, we’ll need some images to work with. You can either create your own, or use the ones my lovely wife has created for the project: a Player image, a Projectile image, and a Target image.

Once you’ve obtained the images, drag them over to the resources folder in XCode, and make sure “Copy items into destination group’s folder (if needed)” is checked.

Now that we have our images, we have to figure out where we want to place the player. Note that in Cocos2D the bottom left corner of the screen has coordinates of (0,0) and the x and y values increase as you move to the upper right. Since this project is in landscape mode, this means that the upper right corner is (480, 320).

Also note that by default when we set the position of an object, the position is relative to the center of the sprite we are adding. So if we wanted our player sprite to be aligned with the left EDGE of the screen horizontally, and vertically centered:

For the x coordinate of the position, we’d set it to [player sprite's width]/2.
For the y coordinate of the position, we’d set it to [window height]/2
Here’s a picture that helps illustrate this a bit better:

Collision Detection

So now we have shurikens flying everywhere – but what our ninja really wants to do is to lay some smack down. So let’s add in some code to detect when our projectiles intersect our targets.

There are various ways to solve this with Cocos2D, including using one of the included physics libraries: Box2D or Chipmunk. However to keep things simple, we are going to implement simple collision detection ourselves.

To do this, we first need to keep better track of the targets and projectiles currently in the scene. Add the following to your HelloWorldScene class declaration:

NSMutableArray *_targets;NSMutableArray *_projectiles;
And initialize the arrays in your init method:

_targets = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];_projectiles = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];
And while we’re thinking of it, clean up the memory in your dealloc method:

[_targets release];_targets = nil;[_projectiles release];_projectiles = nil;
Now, modify your addTarget method to add the new target to the targets array and set a tag for future use:

target.tag = 1;[_targets addObject:target];
And modify your ccTouchesEnded method to add the new projectile to the projectiles array and set a tag for future use:

projectile.tag = 2;[_projectiles addObject:projectile];
Finally, modify your spriteMoveFinished method to remove the sprite from the appropriate array based on the tag:

if (sprite.tag == 1) { // target  [_targets removeObject:sprite];} else if (sprite.tag == 2) { // projectile  [_projectiles removeObject:sprite];}
Compile and run the project to make sure everything is still working OK. There should be no noticeable difference at this point, but now we have the bookkeeping we need to implement some collision detection.

Now add the following method to HelloWorldScene:

- (void)update:(ccTime)dt {   NSMutableArray *projectilesToDelete = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];  for (CCSprite *projectile in _projectiles) {    CGRect projectileRect = CGRectMake(      projectile.position.x - (projectile.contentSize.width/2),       projectile.position.y - (projectile.contentSize.height/2),       projectile.contentSize.width,       projectile.contentSize.height);     NSMutableArray *targetsToDelete = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init];    for (CCSprite *target in _targets) {      CGRect targetRect = CGRectMake(        target.position.x - (target.contentSize.width/2),         target.position.y - (target.contentSize.height/2),         target.contentSize.width,         target.contentSize.height);       if (CGRectIntersectsRect(projectileRect, targetRect)) {        [targetsToDelete addObject:target];				      }						    }     for (CCSprite *target in targetsToDelete) {      [_targets removeObject:target];      [self removeChild:target cleanup:YES];									    }     if (targetsToDelete.count > 0) {      [projectilesToDelete addObject:projectile];    }    [targetsToDelete release];  }   for (CCSprite *projectile in projectilesToDelete) {    [_projectiles removeObject:projectile];    [self removeChild:projectile cleanup:YES];  }  [projectilesToDelete release];}
The above should be pretty clear. We just iterate through our projectiles and targets, creating rectangles corresponding to their bounding boxes, and use CGRectIntersectsRect to check for intersections. If any are found, we remove them from the scene and from the arrays. Note that we have to add the objects to a “toDelete” array because you can’t remove an object from an array while you are iterating through it. Again, there are more optimal ways to implement this kind of thing, but I am going for the simple approach.

You just need one more thing before you’re ready to roll – schedule this method to run as often as possible by adding the following line to your init method:

[self schedule:@selector(update:)];
Give it a compile and run, and now when your projectiles intersect targets they should disappear!

. .Finishing Touches

We’re pretty close to having a workable (but extremely simple) game now. We just need to add some sound effects and music (since what kind of game doesn’t have sound!) and some simple game logic.

If you’ve been following my blog series on audio programming for the iPhone, you’ll be extremely pleased to hear how simple the Cocos2D developers have made it to play BASIC sound effects in your game.

First, drag some background music and a shooting sound effect into your resources folder. Feel free to use the cool background music I made or my awesome pew-pew sound effect, or make your own.

Then, add the following import to the top of your HelloWorldScene.m:

#import "SimpleAudioEngine.h"
In your init method, start up the background music as follows:

[[SimpleAudioEngine sharedEngine] playBackgroundMusic:@"background-music-aac.caf"];
0.99-final update: It seems there might be a minor bug in 0.99-final where the background music will only play once (whereas it should loop) – either that or I’m doing something wrong. For a workaround, see the comments at the end of this article.

And in your ccTouchesEnded method play the sound effect as follows:

[[SimpleAudioEngine sharedEngine] playEffect:@"pew-pew-lei.caf"];
Now, let’s create a new scene that will serve as our “You Win” or “You Lose” indicator. Click on the Classes folder and go to File\New File, and choose Objective-C class, and make sure subclass of NSObject is selected. Click Next, then type in GameOverScene as the filename, and make sure “Also create GameOverScene.h” is checked.

Then replace GameOverScene.h with the following code:

#import "cocos2d.h" @interface GameOverLayer : CCColorLayer {  CCLabel *_label;}@property (nonatomic, retain) CCLabel *label;@end @interface GameOverScene : CCScene {  GameOverLayer *_layer;}@property (nonatomic, retain) GameOverLayer *layer;@end
Then replace GameOverScene.m with the following code:

#import "GameOverScene.h"#import "HelloWorldScene.h" @implementation GameOverScene@synthesize layer = _layer; - (id)init {   if ((self = [super init])) {    self.layer = [GameOverLayer node];    [self addChild:_layer];  }  return self;} - (void)dealloc {  [_layer release];  _layer = nil;  [super dealloc];} @end @implementation GameOverLayer@synthesize label = _label; -(id) init{  if( (self=[super initWithColor:ccc4(255,255,255,255)] )) {     CGSize winSize = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] winSize];    self.label = [CCLabel labelWithString:@"" fontName:@"Arial" fontSize:32];    _label.color = ccc3(0,0,0);    _label.position = ccp(winSize.width/2, winSize.height/2);    [self addChild:_label];     [self runAction:[CCSequence actions:      [CCDelayTime actionWithDuration:3],      [CCCallFunc actionWithTarget:self selector:@selector(gameOverDone)],      nil]];   }	  return self;} - (void)gameOverDone {   [[CCDirector sharedDirector] replaceScene:[HelloWorld scene]]; } - (void)dealloc {  [_label release];  _label = nil;  [super dealloc];} @end
Note that there are two different objects here: a scene and a layer. The scene can contain any number of layers, however in this example it just has one. The layer just puts a label in the middle of the screen, and schedules a transition to occur 3 seconds in the future back to the HelloWorld scene.

Finally, let’s add some extremely basic game logic. First, let’s keep track of the projectiles the player has destroyed. Add a member variable to your HelloWorld class in HelloWorldScene.h as follows:

int _projectilesDestroyed;
Inside HelloWorldScene.m, add an import for the GameOverScene class:

#import "GameOverScene.h"
Increment the count and check for the win condition in your update method inside the targetsToDelete loop right after removeChild:target:

_projectilesDestroyed++;if (_projectilesDestroyed > 30) {  GameOverScene *gameOverScene = [GameOverScene node];  [gameOverScene.layer.label setString:@"You Win!"];  [[CCDirector sharedDirector] replaceScene:gameOverScene];}
And finally let’s make it so that if even one target gets by, you lose. Modify the spriteMoveFinished method by adding the following code inside the tag == 1 case right after removeChild:sprite:

GameOverScene *gameOverScene = [GameOverScene node];[gameOverScene.layer.label setString:@"You Lose :["];[[CCDirector sharedDirector] replaceScene:gameOverScene];
Go ahead and give it a compile and run, and you should now have win and lose conditions and see a game over scene when appropriate!

. .Gimme The Code!

And that’s a wrap! Here’s the full code for the simple Cocos2D iPhone game that we developed thus far.

. .Where To Go From Here?

This project could be a nice basis for playing around some more with Cocos2D by adding some new features into the project. Maybe try adding in a bar chart to show how many more targets you have to destroy before you win (check out the drawPrimitivesTest sample project for examples of how to do that). Maybe add cooler death animations for when the monsters are destroyed (see ActionsTest, EffectsTest, and EffectsAdvancedTest projects for that). Maybe add more sounds, artwork, or gameplay logic just for fun. The sky’s the limit!

About three months after our marriage it was rumoured that four of the Twelve Apostles had been appointed to foreign missions, and were then on their way to England.
The Saints in Britain had been for several years without any missionaries direct from the body of the church, and the announcement of this foreign mission was hailed with joy.
I confess to experiencing much pleasure at the thought of becoming acquainted with a living Apostle. How often in my girlhood I had wished that I had lived when men inspired of God walked the earth. What a joy, I thought, it would have been to have listened to the wisdom of such teachers. Now the time was near when I should realize all the happiness of my day-dreams—when I should really have the privilege of conversing with those chosen men of God. The invitation, therefore, to meet the Conference in London on the 1st of June, was very welcome intelligence.
We went to the London Conference—my husband and I; and there for the first time I met with Apostles, who were also Prophets, and Priests, and High-priests, and Teachers, and Elders, and Deacons—all assembled in solemn convocation.
The four Apostles whom I met at that time were John Taylor, Lorenzo Snow, Erastus Snow, and Franklin D. Richards—pleasant and agreeable men, and withal very fair specimens of Mormon missionaries, who had found favour in the eyes of Brigham Young and of the leaders in Zion, and who had been promoted accordingly. They lived comfortably, wore the finest broadcloth, fashionably cut, and were not averse to gold chains, and charms, and signet-rings, and other personal adornments. They put on no particular airs, were as polite and attentive to ladies as gentlemen always are, and could go to a theatre or any other place of amusement without hesitation. I afterwards discovered that in one particular, at least,[34] if not in all, they resembled the early Apostles, for they too could, like St. Paul, “lead about a sister” without any compunctions of conscience.
The Southampton Saints had hitherto formed only a branch of the London Conference, but did not form a conference of their own. It was now resolved that since so large a number had recently been baptized in Hampshire, the several branches of the church there should be organized into a special conference at Southampton, with Elder Stenhouse as its president; and the Sunday following was appointed for that purpose, when the Apostle Snow, en route to Italy—to which country he had just been appointed missionary—would honour the occasion with his presence.
As we returned, some gentlemen in the same railway carriage, to while away the time, I suppose, entered into a religious discussion. What the subject was I do not now remember; but I can recollect that a good deal was said as to which of all the numerous Christian sects really possessed Divine authority. Elder Stenhouse took an active part in the argument, and being, like all the Mormon Missionaries at that time, very well posted in Scriptural discussions, he attracted considerable attention, and was much complimented by several persons present.
The Apostle Lorenzo Snow was silent all the time, but he took note of all that passed. Elder Stenhouse was a man of great zeal and untiring energy—qualities in which perhaps Brother Snow felt himself a little deficient; and he was going on a mission which required unflagging devotion and perseverance. We had not been an hour at home, before he told my husband that the Lord had thrice revealed to him that he should accompany him to Italy! How often—even while I still clung to Mormonism—did it appear strange to me that the “revelations” of distinguished Saints should so frequently coincide with their own personal wishes, and come at such convenient times.
I had laid aside my travelling-dress, and was hastening to provide some refreshment for the Apostle, when my husband came and told me of the revelation which had been so opportunely received. I was at that time as much an enthusiast as Elder Stenhouse himself, and I felt honoured that my husband should be the first English elder appointed to a foreign mission. Here was the fulfilment of my ambition, that we should be in the forefront of the battle, and should obtain distinction as zealous servants of God. But at what a cost[35] was this ambition purchased! My poor, weak heart sickened at the thought—I had been but four months married.
When the Apostle asked me if I were willing that Elder Stenhouse should go to Italy, I answered “Yes,” though I felt as if my heart would break. I remembered that in my first transport of joy and gratitude after being baptized, I had made a covenant with the Lord that I would do anything which He might require of me; and I dared not rebel, or break that vow. Oh, the agony that fell upon my young heart! It seemed that the weight of a mountain rested upon it when I was told that my husband might be five years absent. He had already been five years a travelling elder without a home, trusting for daily bread to the voluntary kindness of the Saints. He had laboured faithfully, and looked forward to the day when his “Conference” should be established, and he could count upon an improvement in his temporal position, and an early call to emigrate to Zion. In the few months that I had been his wife, it was only natural that I should share his hopes; but just at the moment when they were about to be realized, hopes and expectations were scattered to the winds.
On the following day the Saints assembled, the Southampton Conference was organized, and Elder Stenhouse elected its president. Ten minutes later he was publicly appointed by the Apostle on a mission to Italy.
During the few days which intervened between the time when Elder Stenhouse received his appointment, to the hour of his departure, I enjoyed but little of his society. Arranging the affairs of the Conference which he was leaving, and preparation for his mission, fully occupied his attention. I do not think we either of us uttered a word, when alone together, respecting the future that was before us. It was probably better that we did not. There are moments of our life when silence is better than speech; and it is safer to trust in the mercy of God than to try to shape our own destiny.
The Saints are noted for the fraternal spirit which exists among them. There are, of course, exceptions; but, as a rule, every Mormon is willing to help his brother in the faith, acting upon the principle “One is your Master, even Christ: and all ye are brethren.” The Southampton Saints were no exception to this rule, but showed their kindness both to my husband and myself in a thousand little ways. I have spoken of my unhappiness during that week of preparation, but I must not forget that there were gleams of hope in the darkness.[36] One occasion I shall never forget—a picnic which our friends held as a kind of valedictory feast in honour of the missionaries—of Elder Stenhouse in particular.
Right up the Southampton river, not far from Netley Abbey, is a pleasant and picturesque spot, named Bittern, which I need not too particularly describe, although the memory of its beauty recalls recollections of mingled sadness and pleasure to my mind. There my parents now lived, and thither it was proposed our friends should go. They could obtain all they needed for the picnic at my father’s house, and we could take our good things into the woods, and enjoy ourselves as we pleased. We had a very happy time; for the moment, even I forgot the cloud that was hanging over me; and our dear friends not only enjoyed themselves to the utmost, but seemed bent upon making the time pass pleasantly to every one else.
I had been talking to Sister White about the recent doings of the Saints, the establishment of the Conference and the sending away of Elder Stenhouse. I wanted Sister White, as in fact I wanted every one else, to think that I was perfectly happy in the separation, and that I counted my feelings as a wife as nothing when placed in the balance against my duty as a missionary; and I tried to impress upon her how proud I was that my husband should be the first English Elder entrusted with a foreign mission. We talked together a great deal. She was still quite a young woman, though married, and the mother of four darling little children; but probably she had a better experience than I had, and could see through my attempts to stifle my natural feelings, while at the same time she sympathized with me. She spoke very kindly to me; and as we talked, we wandered inadvertently away from the rest of the party. Suddenly she thought of her little boy, and, mother-like, thinking he might be in danger, ran off in search of him, promising to come back immediately.
I sat down upon the grass to await her return. I was somewhat excited by the conversation which had passed between us; but as I sat musing my agitation began to cool down, and I was soon lost in thought, and did not notice that I was not alone.
I did not hear the light footsteps near me, and did not see a little fairy friend, as I called her, pass between me and the sun. But a tiny hand was laid gently on my shoulder, and looking up I saw the loving eyes of Mary Burton looking straight down into mine.
[37]
“Where have you been, dear?” I asked. “Why, I have hardly seen you all the day.”
“But I knew you were here,” she said, “and I thought you were alone; and I wanted to see you, and talk with you.”
“Come and sit down beside me, Mary,” I said, “and let us have a little chat together.” Then I drew her gently towards me, and she sat down by my side. For a few moments we said nothing, but I was watching her, and waiting to hear what she would say. She seemed such a pretty, such a sweet and gentle girl—more like one of those little birds of glorious plumage and thrilling song that we see glittering among the dew-drops and the dancing leaves, than a child of earth. And I pitied her for her beauty, for such beauty is a snare; and I wondered whether her innocent soul was as fair and glorious before God as her face was sweet to me; and I asked whether, in years to come, when the glory of her childish radiance had passed away, the brightness of a soul pure and serene would lend a new beauty to her features—the beauty, not of childish innocence, but of a noble womanhood.
I took her hand in mine, and asked her some trifling question; but she did not answer. Suddenly she looked up full into my face, and said, “Sister Stenhouse; I’m very, very sorry for you.”
“Sorry for me, dear?” I said. “Why should you be sorry? I am not sad.”
“You shouldn’t say so,” she replied; “you know in your heart you are sad, although you don’t say so. It’s a fine thing, no doubt, for Elder Stenhouse to go away, though for my part I’d rather stop at home if I loved any one there; and at any rate, you must feel sorry that he is going away so far, if you love him.”
“But Mary,” I said, “you know it is his duty to go; and he has been called to it by the Apostle, and it is a great honour.”
“Oh yes, I know that,” she replied, “I know that.” Then we relapsed into silence for some few moments. Presently drawing nearer to me, she said again, quite suddenly, “Sister Stenhouse, do you know the meaning of the word Polygamy?”
“Why, what a funny question to ask me, child!” I exclaimed.
“Child, you call me, Sister Stenhouse; but I’m not a child—at least not quite a child; I shall be fifteen next birthday.”
“Well, dear,” I said, “I did not mean to offend you; and[38] I call you ‘child’ because I love you; but you asked me such a strange question, and used such a strange word.”
This was quite true, for at that time the word Polygamy was as seldom used as the word “polyandry,” or any other word signifying a state of things with which we have nothing to do.
“I’m not offended,” she said; “only people have a way of treating me as if I were only such a very little girl: I suppose I look so.”
She certainly did look so, and I suppose she read my thoughts. Womanhood, by-and-by, brought to her more of reality, both in face and figure, as well as in the terrible facts of life; but at that time the term “little fairy,” which I have so often used respecting her, seemed the most appropriate. The meaning of that terrible word Polygamy she understood, in later years, fully as well as I did.
“Well, dear,” I said, “why did you ask me that strange question?”
“You must promise not to be angry with me if I tell you,” she answered; “and yet I think you ought to know.”
I readily promised—what could I have refused her?—and she said,—
“The other day two of the sisters were at our house—I may not tell you their names for fear of making mischief—and they were talking together between themselves, and did not notice that I was present—or else they didn’t care. And I heard one of them tell the other, that she had heard, secretly, that in Zion men were allowed to have many wives; and she used that word Polygamy very often, and said that was what the people of the world called it.”
“Well, Mary dear,” I replied, “that is no great secret. We have all heard that said before. Wicked people who hate the Gospel say that, and a great deal more, in order to bring scandal upon the Church; but of course it isn’t true.”
“Ah, but I haven’t told you all,” she said. “The sisters had a long talk about it, and they explained whom they heard it from, and it was from no one outside the Church. And then one of them said that Elder Stenhouse had heard all about it, and knew it was true, only of course he did not talk about such things yet; but that the time would come when everyone would acknowledge it, and all the Saints would have many wives. I was frightened when I heard this, and very angry—for I thought of you—and I spoke to her, and said it was all untrue, and I’d ask Elder Stenhouse. And they[39] scolded me very much for saying so, and said it was very wicked for a child to listen; and that was why I did not like you to call me ‘child.’”
“Well, darling,” I said, “I’ll not offend you any more in that way; and it was very good of you to tell me anything you thought I ought to know.” Then I kissed her, and continued, “But, after all, I don’t think it’s of any consequence. It’s the old scandal, just as in the early days they said wicked things of Christ and His apostles. Elder Stenhouse knows all that people say, but he has told me again and again that there is not a word of truth in it; and I believe him.”
“You think so, Sister Stenhouse,” she replied, “and I suppose I ought to think so too; but if it’s all false how did people first begin to think of it? People don’t say that the Mormons are murderers or thieves, because we have given them no reason to think so. Then why should they think of such an unheard-of thing as Polygamy—surely there must have been some reason. Don’t you think so?”
“No, dear,” I answered, “Elder Stenhouse says that some very wicked men have sometimes joined the Church, and have done all manner of shocking things, so that they had to be cut off; and then they went about trying to make other people believe that the Mormons were as wicked as they were. There was John C. Bennett, who lived a frightful life at Nauvoo, and then tried to make out that Joseph Smith was as bad as he was. And Marsh, the president of the twelve apostles, and Orson Hyde, when they apostatized not only said bad things of Joseph, but took affidavit, and swore solemnly before the magistrates, that the prophet had been guilty of the most fearful crimes.”
I kissed her again; and she said, “Well, perhaps you are right;” but I could see that in her heart she was not convinced.
Then we talked of ourselves and all that interested us, and she told me all her childish hopes and ambitions; and to me—young as I was myself—it was pleasant to listen to her innocent prattle. She promised to come and see me when Elder Stenhouse had gone, and I should be left alone; and when we got back to the rest of the party we were as firm friends as if we had known each other a lifetime.
At midnight, Saturday, June 15th, 1850, the steamer left Southampton for Havre-de-Grace, bearing on board the first two Mormon missionaries to Italy; one of them was my husband.

The Saints had called in the evening to bid Elder Stenhouse good-bye; and as he was, of course, to travel “without purse or scrip,” they vied with each other in showing their appreciation of his position and his devotion to the faith. The poorest among them would not be denied the privilege of contributing their mites to aid in the conversion of the Italians; and none of the brethren felt that they could show too much kindness to the departing missionary. Just in this way have all the foreign missions of the Mormon Church been projected and sustained; the elements of success were always present—devotion and self-abnegation on the part of the missionaries, and an earnest, self-sacrificing disposition on the part of the people, commanding respect, however erroneous or foolish the foundation of their faith.
In the bustle of departure, Mr. Stenhouse seemed never to have thought about himself, and certainly he made no preparation for me. I had full confidence in him, however, and loved him devotedly, and knew that my love was returned. But men who look for miracles, and count upon special providences for daily bread, are not generally very prudent or far-seeing in their domestic arrangements. Elder Stenhouse had been told that “the Lord would provide,” and it therefore seemed to him superfluous that he should interfere; it would have been a lack of faith to have shown too much interest in what might become of me. He left me with only 1l.
I now realized the loneliness of my position; there was no earthly friend to whom I could turn for sympathy at a time like this. Before my Heavenly Father alone I could pour out the bitterness of my soul and all my griefs, and in His presence weep and pray.
